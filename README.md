This is a sorting algorithm visualizer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It shows how different sorting algorithms work step by step with a visual representation. You can either generate a random array or enter your own numbers to see them being sorted in real time.

The visualizer currently supports bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, and merge sort. As the algorithm runs, each swap gets logged, and the bars change color to show what’s happening. If the array is already sorted, the program skips the sort and logs that it's sorted. The visualizer also displays the Big-O notation of each algorithm when it’s selected.

This project is meant to be a fun way to learn about sorting algorithms. There’s still room for improvement, like adding more algorithms, adjusting animation speed, or polishing the interface, but it’s already working well.

To run it, just open the index.html file in your browser.
